This is a test book but this is also a test of if the parts work within the book. All new Paragraphs should work properly hopefully and everything is good.
This should be a new line.
When WWII ended in 1945, two countries emerged from the rubble and devastation, the US and the USSR. The US suffered the least from WWII, both socially and economically. The US exerted its economic superiority with the Marshall Plan, giving money to ruined European countries to support their rehabilitation, and to extend the US’s influence into Europe with the US’s capabilities in infrastructure. Whereas the USSR, influenced by socialism as introduced by Marx, saw themselves as in a conflict with bourgeois capitalism and democracy. What caused the Soviet Union to change from communist reconstruction and stabilization under Lenin to socialist and violent control and influence under Stalin? The main reason for the Cold War tensions people are familiar with today is dramatic changes and developments in Soviet foreign policy, and the USSR’s motive for extending its power changed from converting Russia into socialist and then communist under Lenin to converting the rest of the world into communist under Stalin. The Soviet Union saw the US’s rebuilding in Europe as an attempt to take over Europe because of its superior economy and power and eventually destroy the Soviet system. Immediately after WWII, the Soviet Union expanded its sphere of influence, taking over portions of Eastern Europe where the Red Army had beaten the Nazis. In response to this, the US initiated containment, a policy that encouraged non-Communist/Socialist countries to stand up to the Soviets and prevent their spread of influence. In 1922, most governments internationally regarded the Soviet régime as a pariah because of its advocacy of communism, and thus most states did not give it diplomatic recognition. Less than a quarter century later the Soviet Union not only had official relations with the majority of the nation-states of the world, but had progressed to the role of a superpower. Marxist–Leninist ideology reinforced other characteristics of Soviet political culture that created an attitude of competition and conflict with other states. Before WWII, Lenin and the Bolsheviks shifted their ideological focus from the world revolution and building socialism around the globe to building socialism inside the Soviet Union, while keeping some of the rhetoric and operations of the Comintern continuing. After WWII, however, when the Soviet Union was economically devastated but politically empowering, Stalin took over after Lenin died in 1924. Stalin realized that the USSR was already stable as a communist power. Soviet foreign policy underwent a series of changes during the first decade of Stalin’s rule. Soon after assuming control of the party, Stalin oversaw a radicalization of Soviet foreign policy that complemented his strenuous domestic policies. To heighten the urgency of his demands for modernization, Stalin portrayed the Western powers, particularly France, as warmongers eager to attack the Soviet Union. Russia has experienced quite a few dramatic changes to its society, government, and economy. Another major change in Russia’s history was its abolishment of serfdom. Alexander II was one of Russia’s more liberal leaders. He recognized that Russia’s feudal system – long since abandoned by Western European powers – was a liability. Russia’s weakness had been demonstrated by its defeat in the Crimean War, in which its armies of conscripted serfs had been regularly outmatched by the volunteer armies of France and Great Britain. The war effort had also been hampered because Russia’s largely agricultural society was unable to compete with the industrialised Empires of Western Europe. Alexander published his Emancipation Manifesto in March 1861. The Manifesto was quickly turned into law, and all privately owned serfs were given the right to become free citizens, free to marry, own land and their own businesses. Those tied to the land were entitled to buy the land they had previously leased, but not at a very good rate.
